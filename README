auto-hibernate checks periodically if this computer should go to hibernation.
You should run auto-hibernate periodically as cron job.
The conditions are:

-Does a screen process exist

-Is a samba share accessed

-Is a user logged

If all these preconditions are false for the last 30 Minutes the machine goes
into hibernation.

You can wake the machine up by sending a magic wol packet.
