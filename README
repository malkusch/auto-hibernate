Auto-hibernate checks periodically if this computer should go to hibernation.
You should run auto-hibernate periodically as a cron job.
The conditions are:

-Does a screen process exist?

-Is a network connection established?

-Is a user logged in?

If all these preconditions are false for the last 30 Minutes the machine goes
into hibernation.

You can wake the machine up by sending a magic wol packet.
